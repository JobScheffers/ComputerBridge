BridgeFundamentals:

- To load the PBN in Bridge Composer, the Score should be fixed, and it is missing Room information.
- 

When playing a match the is normally a 
[Room ""]
with value "Open" or "Closed"

These are optional but would be nice to have
[HomeTeam ""]
[VisitTeam ""]





TableManager:

- 1 button: start a match, dan dialog met port, pbn en 3 mogelijkheden:
   1. open and closed room
   2. open room
   3. closed room (continuation of a match)

- 1 tournament, zelfs als er 2 tafels actief zijn, wel 2 tournamentControllers

- I think it would be a good idea to flush the PBN-file and trace after each board, so it is possible to check a deal, while running the match.

- Last night the match halted at board 52. TMJob was waiting for a opening lead from BEN, and BEN had sent the card.
I can't reproduce, but is there a way to start a match from a given board (Keeping the score from the other boards)

- It would be nice if there was a way to see how the actual play and bidding was in a played game directly from TableManager, but I can of course just open the PBN in Bridge Composer or Double Dummy Solver.
But then you should change the score from [Score "100000"] in the PBN-file to just [Score ""] or leave it out.

- When I look at the score table I think you should use -- in both columns for a push, or display nothing.


- I think I would be nice if being able to stop a match (Freeing the tracefile), and also to skip a board.

Attached: I think naming should also be updated as it is now with instant replay so both tables are in the file
In the event name you can use the Team names
I would be nice with a final (and running score)
 
- When the last board is played you should stop Total time
